This project is a simple billiard game. A unique characteristics of this project is that it uses Collada with DirectX. I also adopted to use PhysX for physics calculation.

Requirements:
  * [DirectX 9c](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&displaylang=en)
  * [PhysX](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/physx_downloads.html)
  * [OpenAL](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip)
